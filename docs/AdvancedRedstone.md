# **Advanced Redstone!**

Advanced Redstone, simply put, is a hub of several different features. It spices up the regular gameplay with things like new dispenser uses, technical mechanics, minecart enhancements, and more! So without further ado, let's list off what we've added:

## _Ammeter_
The ammeter is used for measuring the redstone levels/amperage in all wires and devices, which is used to debug any contraptions you might have, mostly being used for anything using comparators.

To use the ammeter, simply hold a piece of coal and click on the thing you wish to measure, as seen below!

## _Better Sponges_
It's in the name to be honest, it changes sponges for the better in a couple of ways: The first being that sponges have an increased radius of 6, the original being 5 (that means a 6x6 spherical area.) And the second change is that sponges will now ward off any further water coming into the area, so no need to worry about all that water in temples filling what you just emptied. All you have to do is run a redstone signal into the sponge, and while it's powered, it'll keep all that water at bay!

## _Dispenser Recipes_
Now this is some of the real fun, using dispensers you can now make a few different contraptions! These are made by filling the dispenser interface with the following layouts, and once that's been done all you need to do is activate the dispenser with redstone to then activate the machine.
- The cannon dispenser, lives up to its name of being a cannon and propels TNT out of it with a lot of force. Using the layout below, you just activate it and let the bombs fly! ![https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/335834907156676609/819046725889163275/cannondisp.png](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/335834907156676609/819046725889163275/cannondisp.png)
- The fan dispenser, using this you can push all entities 5 blocks away, maybe you can use it for traps or interesting obstacle courses? Use the picture below to fill your dispenser, and I'm sure you'll be a *fan* of this mechanic in no time.

- And last but not least, the vacuum dispenser, which is essentially the opposite of the fan. It'll pull entities in from 5 blocks in front of it, so any pesky mob drop just out of reach will be yours once you use the layout below!

## _Jack-O-Lantern_
A minor feature, but one that some may find a fun purpose for; Jack-O-Lanterns are now a togglable block, using redstone you can turn them off and on as you please, maybe as sudden lighting for some sort of haunted house?

## _Lightstone_
Another nifty feature like the ammeter, this is used to check the light levels of blocks! By simply holding a piece of glowstone, as pictured below, and clicking on the block you wish to check, you can see if the lighting is up to par with what you need!
>Most mobs can spawn at a light level of 8 and below, so use this to make sure any land you might have won't have any pesky mobs come visit!

## _Minecart Rail Placer_
A lot of people find railroads pretty tedious to make, and within good reason. With this, however, a lot of the work you'd need to do is eliminated! By putting some rails in a minecart with chest (or a minecart with hopper) and sending it on its merry way, it'll lay down tracks in a straight path until stopped or it runs out.

---

## _Payment (Redstone Mechanic)_
A pretty nifty feature that can simplify some mechanics, using a sign you can now turn money into machinery! Using the pictures below as reference, make a sign with [Pay] on the 2nd line, the money you're asking for on the 3rd, and your name (or another player if you're setting this up for bossman), and when a player clicks it, it'll activate the lever on the back!

ADK AureliumSkills

Here in ADK, we do things a bit differently than most. For AureliumSkills to not be insanely over powered, we have changed around many variables dealing with Damage, Health, and Damage Reduction. We have also changed the leveling formula to be closer to that of Runescapes instead of the base leveling formula included with the plugin. We also go from level 1 to 100, instead of the base 1 to 96. You can also check out a basic wiki for AureliumSkills [here!](https://wiki.aurelium.dev/skills/)

## ***Increased Drops***

Increased drops are gained by leveling up your skills. The more you level up your skills in a certain area, the more drops you will then get from doing that said activity. For Example, as you level up your Mining Skills you will then get more drops from blocks, like stone, different ores, etc....

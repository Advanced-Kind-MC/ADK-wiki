The Deep Wilderness

Noted as Advanced-Kind's 1.18, and one of the biggest updates since launch, the Deep Wilderness adds a whole variety of things from loot to a new part of the map and even more challenges!

---

## ***How To Get There***
Within the normal world there are 4 regions which will take you to 4 different points in the deep wilderness. When you approach the regions, then run the command /journey begin and they will pay 5 thousand dollars to teleport to the deep wilderness map. Coords are listed below (in order of X, Y, Z):

#### **The North Region**
**16, 64, -12178** to **1324, 64, -11726**
#### **The South Region**
**8244, 64, 12172** to **10376, 64, 11464**
#### **The East Region**
**12180, 64, 11464** to **11880, 64, 4460**
#### **The West Region**
**-12187, 64, 1250** to **-11959, 64, 835**

## ***The Rules***
The rules in the deep wilderness remain the same as the normal world, with a few exceptions to make things more difficult:
- No breaking blocks or anything, no hiding in a little foxhole to avoid these mobs.
- When you die, you don't drop anything! You keep it all, luckily.
- However, you will be set on a cooldown from re-entering the world, so when you die you can't just hop back in for a few hours.

And that's pretty much all the information about what changes in the new map, so enjoy!

## ***New Equipment/Items***

The Deep Wilderness adds new materials and drop (listed in the section below), and so you can use these new obtainable items to make different recipes for gear and items:

#### **Alternatives/Bonus Effects**

All armor does not have thorns by default, in order to add thorns to the armor you will need to add ***1 wither rose*** to the forge.

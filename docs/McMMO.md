ADK McMMO

Here in ADK, we do things a bit differently than most. We run a modified version of the McMMO plugin, and most of the changes are to the leveling system. All levels go from 1 to 100 instead of 1 to 1000 (basically dividing the initial values by ten). Then, leveling these skills up is just slightly harder in ADK.
> The basic wiki for McMMO can be found [here!](https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Main_Page)

## ***Double Drops***

Double drops (from skills) in ADK have been reduced from the default, but the good news is if you're willing to put in the time and grind, you can obtain **GUARANTEED** double drops. By reaching level 500 in any skill with a double drop trait, you will then get guaranteed double drops on things you harvest.

## ***Alchemy***

Although we have many cool, unique, and interesting [brews](https://wiki.advanced-kind.com/brewery), we do of course have McMMO alchemy. However, the recipes have been rearranged just a little bit, so the actual levels you earn new potions go as such:
 - LVL 25: Dullness, Hunger
 - LVL 35: Nausea
 - LVL 50: Water Breathing, Saturation
 - LVL 65: Leaping, Absorption
 - LVL 75: Decay, Health Boost
 - LVL 85: Resistance 
 - LVL 100: Haste

Ingredients to brew each potion will remain the same as the wiki, so good luck working your way up to haste!

## ***Fishing***

In McMMO fishing, you are able to fish up a variety of things, including netherite equipment and enchanted books! There are six levels of loot obtainable with fishing, each increasing in quality as you climb, here are some examples:

|Common|Uncommon|Rare|Epic|Legendary|Mythic|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Leather Armor|Stone Tools|Iron Tools|Iron Armor|Diamond Equipment|Netherite Armor|
|Wooden Tools|Gold & Iron Ingots|Nametags|Ghast Tears|Nautilus Shells|Netherite Tools|
|Lapis|Golden Gear|Ender Pearls & Bows|Diamonds|Netherite Scrap|Enchanted Books|

And don't worry, your enchanted books will be useful more often than not, as they have been limited to a pool of: **Fortune**, **Protection**,  **Mending**, **Unbreaking**, **Soul Speed**, **Curse of Binding**, **Curse of Vanishing**, **Channeling**, and **Looting**.
Each rank of the treasure hunter increases your odds of getting those higher rewards, and these are the levels at which it'll increase, along with percentage changes:
|% Numbers|Lvl 1|Lvl 25|Lvl 35|Lvl 50|Lvl 65|Lvl 75|Lvl 85|Lvl 100|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Common**|7.5|6.5|3.5|2|1.5|1|.25|.1|
|**Uncommon**|1.25|1.75|2.75|3.5|3.75|3.25|2.75|1.5|
|**Rare**|.25|.75|1.25|2.25|2.5|3.75|4|6|
|**Epic**|.1|.5|1|1.5|2|2.5|5|7.5|
|**Legendary**|.01|.05|.1|1|1|1.5|2.5|5|
|**Mythic**|.01|.01|.01|.01|.01|.05|.1|.25|

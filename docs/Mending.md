Likelihood is if you're an average ADK player and looking to make some pretty cool gear, you're going to need some mending books. Unlike most servers, we here in ADK don't have villagers to make mending worthless, but instead have several alternatives!

Here are all the different ways one can get mending on the server:

## _Voting_
Probably the most reliable method of obtaining mending books, [voting](https://wiki.advanced-kind.com/#villagers-and-voting) for the server will give you the keys you need to open our free crate at spawn! With every attempt at the crate, you have a 1.5-3.0% chance to get a book, just for helping the server out!

## _Money_
Not the most exciting way to get your mending books, but still reliable nonetheless: money. 90% of the ADK market is determined by mending books changing hands, so if you're in need, the auction house is almost always selling them! Be warned though, as mending is usually a rare commodity, it'll be going for high prices. However, if you're in need of money, remember to check out [the money-making guide](https://wiki.advanced-kind.com/money) for any tips and tricks, and good luck in getting yourself fully geared up!

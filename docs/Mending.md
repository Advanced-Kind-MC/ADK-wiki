Likelihood is if you're an average ADK player and looking to make some pretty cool gear, you're going to need some mending books. Unlike most servers, we here in ADK don't have villagers to make mending worthless, but instead have several alternatives!

Here are all the different ways one can get mending on the server:

## _Voting_
Probably the most reliable method of obtaining mending books, [voting](https://wiki.advanced-kind.com/#villagers-and-voting) for the server will give you the keys you need to open our free crate at spawn! With every attempt at the crate, you have a 1.5-3.0% chance to get a book, just for helping the server out!

Also when voting, you are given Vote Points. Vote Points are used in the vote shop, which can be opened with **/voteshop**. You get 1 Vote Point per vote, and a bonus 2 Vote Points if you vote for all vote sites in a single day.

## _Money_
Not the most exciting way to get your mending books, but still reliable nonetheless: money. 90% of the ADK market is determined by mending books changing hands, so if you're in need, the auction house is almost always selling them! Be warned though, as mending is usually a rare commodity, it'll be going for high prices. However, if you're in need of money, remember to check out [the money-making guide](https://wiki.advanced-kind.com/money) for any tips and tricks, and good luck in getting yourself fully geared up!

## _End City and Nether Bastion Raiding_
Another great way to obtain mending would be through raiding the End Cities and Nether Bastions. Our End and Nether resource worlds reset once a month, meaning there are always fresh spawns of gear that has a chance to have the Mending enchant already on them.

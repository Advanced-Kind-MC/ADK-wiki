Advanced-Kind features Brewery, a plugin that adds an extra challenge to the towny experience; being able to walk in a straight line. 
It allows players to:

 - Master the brewing of alcoholic drinks.
- Experience what it's like to be drunk in Minecraft.
- Regret their decisions in the morning.

Unfortunately, cracking open a cold one takes more than just a trip to your local pub.
Keep in mind that:
- Brewing can only be done within towns.
- Depending on the recipe, the process may be more or less difficult/time consuming.
- The following instructions describe the common procedure.

---
## Getting Started
### Fermentation
The first step to becoming a master brewer is to **FERMENT** your ingredients.
1. Place a cauldron over a fire or other heat source.
2. Fill it with water.
3. Add your ingredients by right clicking.
4. Wait a few minutes while they ferment.
5. Fill your glass bottles.

:::tip
Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting.
:::

### Distillation
The next is to **DISTILL** your previous bottles.
1. Put the bottle with ferment into a brewing stand.
1. Put glowstone dust as a filter into the brewing stand.

### Aging
Cheers, you've made it to the final step; **AGING**. 
To do this, you'll need a barrel.
- Depending on its size, you can age more or less bottles at a time. 
- After creating your barrel, simply but the brews inside.
- Be patient for the brews to complete!

There are multiple different barrels that can be used for the aforementioned.
Keep in mind:
- Depending on the recipe, the type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged brew. 
- The barrel should not be destroyed while aging, as it would leak the brews.

#### Barrel Sizes:
Small: Minecraft 1.14 Barrel
